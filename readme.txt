A plugin to manage ALL your tracking code and conversion pixels, simply.
Compatible with Facebook Ads, Google Adwords and ALL kind of Saas tool.

== Description ==

Tracking Code manager is a plugin that give you the ability to manage ALL your tracking code and scripts in one single page.

It doesn’t matter the place where you want to put your code, because with Tracking Code Manager you can put it wherever you want, with no restrictions.

Let’s say you are using on your website Google Analytics, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Retargeting, Google Remarketing, Zendesk, a Live Chat tool, eye tracking analytics, popups, affiliate tracking pixels and so on...

For every single service you use, you’ll have to put a script or a tracking pixel in the <head> or <body> tag of your WordPress site OR in some of its pages.

Tracking Code Manager plugin allows you to gather EVERY code and snippet displaying them exactly where you want, whether in the whole site or in specific pages and posts.

THE REAL PROBLEM:

We are living in the Saas era, where online services manage all kind of software, analysis and advanced tools. Since every one of them needs a script or a tracking code, why don’t we take it easy with the fast Tracking Code Manager plugin?

FORGET THE UPDATING PROBLEM

Putting the tracking code directly in the theme files, you risk to lose important trackings or external service integrations when it will be updated.

With Tracking Code Manager you can forget about this problem also if you will change your theme in the future.
